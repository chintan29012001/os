Since we have less than 1 mb of memory the total memory available in both modes would be the same for both modes but incase of long mode there is a need for a descriptor table and paging to be implemented hence there is a space and time overhead. Hence for 320 kb we would use real mode (16 bit) .
The following would be the benefits of real mode-
1. Faster memory access since there are no descriptor tables to check smaller registers.
2. Availability of Advance low level bios functions.
3. Access to all 32bit registers.
There are some downsides to using to real mode-:
1. No hardware based protection or virtual memory.
2. No security mechanisms against bugs or malicious programs.


the following would be benefits of long mode:
1. has security protocols
2. has hardward based protection
